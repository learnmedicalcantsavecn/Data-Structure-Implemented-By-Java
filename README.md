# Introduction

A series of data structures implemented using the Java language.

Project language level is 8 , build by Maven.

# Getting started

I put the source code in the `java` directory and the test code in the `test` directory.

We use the most popular battle-proven open source Java technologies.

Before you dive into the material, you should be familiar with various principles.

All designs should be as simple as possible. You should start with KISS, YAGNI,
and Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work principles. Complexity and
patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practical
extensibility.

Once you are familiar with these concepts you can start drilling down into
patterns by any of the following approaches

 - Using difficulty tags, `Difficulty-Beginner`, `Difficulty-Intermediate` & `Difficulty-Expert`.
 - Using pattern categories, `Creational`, `Behavioral`, and others.
 - Search for a specific pattern. Can't find one? Please report a new pattern [here](https://github.com/ximingxing/Close-Look-Java/issues).

Hopefully you find the object oriented solutions presented on this site useful
in your architectures and have as much fun learning them as we had developing them.
